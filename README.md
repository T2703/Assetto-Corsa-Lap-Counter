Running the app:
- Install the app.
- Extract the file.
- Open up the Assetto-Corsa-Tire-Temperature-App-main folder.
- Find the folder.
- Find your AC directory.
- Find the apps folders.
- Put the Tire Temp folder into the python folder.
Another way:
- Install the app.
- Extract the file (if you want to).
- Open up the Assetto-Corsa-Tire-Temperature-App-main folder.
- Find the Tire Temp folder.
- Drag and drop the file into Content Manager (make sure that it is opened).
- Install in there.
- Go to the contents tab.
- Go to apps.
- Make sure Tire Temp is activated.

I guess if you did the first way and have CM you don't have to install it in CM you can just activate it. 

A simple app that I wanted to create and can be useful if you want to create some apps on Assetto feel free to take a look and always give credit.
